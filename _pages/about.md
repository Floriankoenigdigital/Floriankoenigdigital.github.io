Dr.-Ing. Florian König studied mechanical engineering at RWTH Aachen University from 2008 to 2014, first in the bachelor's program with a focus on "design engineering" and then in the master's program "development and design". In his master's thesis at Bosch Rexroth AG, Mr. König dealt with tribochemical reactions in axial piston pumps and their consideration in contact simulation.

From March 2015 to December 2020, Mr. König worked as a research associate in the bearing technology department and from July 2018 to December 2020, he was responsible for the "Plain Bearings" group in his role as group leader. The main topic of his research work is the simulation-based wear prediction of oil-lubricated radial plain bearings.

During his doctoral phase, Mr. König has (co-)authored about 10 scientific publications (most of them are available on Researchgate) and has spoken at more than 20 events.

Since January 2021, Mr. König has been responsible for the tribology division as division manager.
